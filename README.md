# PokecordBulking
A python self-bot made for Pokecord players who want an easier method to bulk (mass-buy) pokemon off the market!

# Requirements
1. Add me on Discord to purchase the full version, or if you have any questions.
2. Discord: Amaranth#7483
3. Price: 15USD [PayPal, Venmo, BTC Accepted]

# Safety & Security
Due to Pokecord & Discord's nature, please be aware of the following:

1. Do not use a self-bot on your main account. Use a fresh alt.
2. Do not run any self-bot on any account for longer than 14 to 16 hours at a time. Take a 4 to 6 hour break.
3. Do not use this in a public server, and then come to me that you were banned/blacklisted/wiped.
4. Do not talk about it in public servers, or to people you don't trust. No one is your friend, they will rat you out.
5. Be mindful of large pokemon movements. Be smart, not greedy.
6. Do not use the Pokecord Exchange server, use the website version.

# Terms of Service

1. There are no refunds. It is non-transferrable.
2. I will offer support on Discord to the Discord accounts that purchase the script.
3. If there are changes/updates to python that render the script unusable, DM me and I'll give you the updated one.
4. If you cannot host the bot yourself, I can do this for you, for $2.50 a month.
5. Do not re-distribute this script in any form or fashion.
